### Definition
Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problems

This reduces the unnecessary and repetitive tasks that are a apart of the machine learning pipeline and reduces the time, improves the efficiency and improves the automation capability of the ML workflow.

It reduces, partially or fully, the tasks such as data preparation, model selection, model hyper parameters, and model compression parameters.



### Types of AutoML
AutoML tools can be of no code or low code type: depending on ease of use, UI, Level of Automation etc. 

**No Code**: Can be used by persona such as Business Analysts and Domain Experts too, with little to no coding knowledge

**Low Code**: Can be used by persona like Data Scientists to ease their tasks and improve efficiency, reduce repetitive work and give better results faster.



AutoML frameworks and tools help automate the following parts in the ML pipeline:
